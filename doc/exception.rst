Exception API
=============

Exception definition
--------------------

All the exceptions that can be thrown by the underlying Tango C++ API are available
in the PyTango python module. Hence a user can catch one of the following
exceptions:

    - :class:`DevFailed`
    - :class:`ConnectionFailed`
    - :class:`CommunicationFailed`
    - :class:`WrongNameSyntax`
    - :class:`NonDbDevice`
    - :class:`WrongData`
    - :class:`NonSupportedFeature`
    - :class:`AsynCall`
    - :class:`AsynReplyNotArrived`
    - :class:`EventSystemFailed`
    - :class:`NamedDevFailedList`
    - :class:`DeviceUnlocked`

When an exception is caught, the sys.exc_info() function returns a tuple of three
values that give information about the exception that is currently being handled.
The values returned are (type, value, traceback).
Since most functions don't need access to the traceback, the best solution is to
use something like exctype, value = sys.exc_info()[:2] to extract only the exception
type and value. If one of the Tango exceptions is caught, the exctype will be class
name of the exception (DevFailed, .. etc) and the value a tuple of dictionary objects
all of which containing the following kind of key-value pairs:

- **reason**: a string describing the error type (more readable than the associated error code)
- **desc**: a string describing in plain text the reason of the error.
- **origin**: a string giving the name of the (C++ API) method which thrown the exception
- **severity**: one of the strings WARN, ERR, PANIC giving severity level of the error.

    import tango

    #  How to protect the script from exceptions raised by the Tango
    try:
        # Get proxy on a non existing device should throw an exception
        device = tango.DeviceProxy("non/existing/device")
    except DevFailed as df:
        print("Failed to create proxy to non/existing/device:\n%s" % df)


Throwing exception in a device server
-------------------------------------

The C++ :class:`~tango::Except` class with its most important methods have
been wrapped to Python. Therefore, in a Python device server, you have the
following methods to throw, re-throw or print a Tango::DevFailed exception :

- :meth:`~tango.Except.throw_exception` which is a static method
- :meth:`~tango.Except.re_throw_exception` which is also a static method
- :meth:`~tango.Except.print_exception` which is also a static method

The following code is an example of a command method requesting a command on a
sub-device and re-throwing the exception in case of::

    try:
        dev.command_inout("SubDevCommand")
    except tango.DevFailed as df:
        tango.Except.re_throw_exception(df,
            "MyClass_CommandFailed",
            "Sub device command SubdevCommand failed",
            "Command()")

:line 2: Send the command to the sub device in a try/catch block
:line 4-6: Re-throw the exception and add a new level of information in the exception stack

   :show-inheritance:
   :members:

.. autoexception:: tango.DevFailed
   :show-inheritance:
   :members:

.. autoexception:: tango.ConnectionFailed
   :show-inheritance:

    This exception is thrown when a problem occurs during the connection
    establishment between the application and the device. The API is stateless.
    This means that DeviceProxy constructors filter most of the exception
    except for cases described in the following table.

    The desc DevError structure field allows a user to get more precise information. These informations are :

    **DB_DeviceNotDefined**
        The name of the device not defined in the database
    **API_CommandFailed**
        The device and command name
    **API_CantConnectToDevice**
        The device name
    **API_CorbaException**
        The name of the CORBA exception, its reason, its locality, its completed
        flag and its minor code
    **API_CantConnectToDatabase**
        The database server host and its port number
    **API_DeviceNotExported**
        The device name


.. autoexception:: tango.CommunicationFailed
   :show-inheritance:

    This exception is thrown when a communication problem is detected during
    the communication between the client application and the device server. It
    is a two levels Tango::DevError structure. In case of time-out, the DevError
    structures fields are:

    +-------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+----------+
    | Level |      Reason        |                   Desc                          | Severity |
    +=======+====================+=================================================+==========+
    |   0   | API_CorbaException | CORBA exception fields translated into a string |   ERR    |
    +-------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+----------+
    |   1   | API_DeviceTimedOut | String with time-out value and device name      |   ERR    |
    +-------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+----------+

    For all other communication errors, the DevError structures fields are:

    +-------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+----------+
    | Level |         Reason          |                     Desc                           | Severity |
    +=======+=========================+====================================================+==========+
    |   0   | API_CorbaException      |   CORBA exception fields translated into a string  |   ERR    |

    This exception is thrown by the API layer when a request to a feature
    implemented in Tango device interface release n is requested for a device
    implementing Tango device interface n-x. There is one possible value for
    the reason field which is API_UnsupportedFeature.

.. autoexception:: tango.AsynCall
   :show-inheritance:

    This exception is thrown by the API layer when a the asynchronous model id
    badly used. This exception has only one level of Tango::DevError structure.
    The possible value for the reason field are :

.. autoexception:: tango.AsynReplyNotArrived
   :show-inheritance:

    This exception is thrown by the API layer when:

        - a request to get asynchronous reply is made and the reply is not yet arrived

        failed when it tries to register the event. Most likely, it means that
        there is no event property defined
    **API_EventNotFound**
        Occurs when using a wrong event identifier in the unsubscribe_event
        method


.. autoexception:: tango.DeviceUnlocked
   :show-inheritance:

    This exception is thrown by the API layer when a device locked by the
    process has been unlocked by an admin client. This exception has two levels
    of Tango::DevError structure. There is only possible value for the reason
    field which is

    **API_DeviceUnlocked**
        The device has been unlocked by another client (administration client)

    The first level is the message reported by the Tango kernel from the server
    side. The second layer is added by the client API layer with informations on
    which API call generates the exception and device name.

.. autoexception:: tango.NotAllowed
   :show-inheritance:


.. autoexception:: tango.NamedDevFailedList
   :show-inheritance:

    This exception is only thrown by the DeviceProxy::write_attributes()
    method. In this case, it is necessary to have a new class of exception
    to transfer the error stack for several attribute(s) which failed during
    the writing. Therefore, this exception class contains for each attributes
    which failed :

        - The name of the attribute
        - Its index in the vector passed as argumen tof the write_attributes() method
        - The error stack
